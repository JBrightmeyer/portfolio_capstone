API - https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28&tool=javascript

Future Goals: 
 - Update Entire Backend to rely on a RESTful API.  Move all editing/adding capabilities to responsive javascript requests and bring app down to 6 different pages.
 - Add Unit Tests so as to not just rely on Functional Testing
 - Firm up security and request limits then deploy website
